\subsection{Overview of Data Sources}

We have 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hand-made dataset using state resources as well as other databases
    \item IPEDS
    \item IPUMS CPS
\end{itemize}

Quick to-do
\begin{itemize}
\item needs number of schools
\item number of graduates over time
\item retention rate over time

\end{itemize}
