# Occupational Licensing Study
Data and code for some data analytics concerning occupational licensing, with a potential focus on Hawaii. This work leverages on the current Economics literature revolving around occupational licensing, and will take an approach similar seen in many recent papers that employ econometric models. There may be additional theoretical models created, but I will note those in the documentation as time goes on.
