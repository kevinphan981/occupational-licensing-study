# Occupational Licensing Study
Data and code for some data analytics concerning occupational licensing, with a potential focus on Hawaii. This work leverages on the current Economics literature revolving around occupational licensing, and will take an approach similar seen in many recent papers that employ econometric models. There may be additional theoretical models created, 
but I will note those in the documentation as time goes on. It is meant to analyze the changes in a select few occupations, not everything in aggregate (that would be far too much).

The fields in question:
1. Cosmetology
2. Electricians
3. Plumbing
4. Really anything related to house building


# TODO: 

1. *Begin to compile data sources into sets of CSV files, begin cleaning to get clean data sets.*
2. Begin writing TeX file to accompany what I am doing, explaining the methodology and sources (will use Pandoc to later convert to docx)
3. Begin drafting model to implement, with potential visualizations to build the story.


# Notes

It seems like some education data can be read from the `educationdata` library from the Urban Institute. I still need to assemble a dataset for 
changes in licensing requirements for my desired professions. It works for certain endpoints, but generally, I have been very disappointed with how it uses the data from IPEDS, which 
is the data that I need the most for this project.
