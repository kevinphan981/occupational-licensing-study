# Occupational Licensing Study
Data and code for some data analytics concerning occupational licensing, with a potential focus on Hawaii. This work leverages on the current Economics literature revolving around occupational licensing, and will take an approach similar seen in many recent papers that employ econometric models. There may be additional theoretical models created, but I will note those in the documentation as time goes on.

# TODO: 

1. Begin to compile data sources into sets of CSV files, begin cleaning to get clean data sets.
2. Begin writing TeX file to accompany what I am doing, explaining the methodology and sources (will use Pandoc to later convert to docx)


# Notes

It seems like some education data can be read from the `educationdata` library from the Urban Institute. I still need to assemble a dataset for 
changes in licensing requirements for my desired professions.
